ORID Practice:

Objective (O) [What did we learn today? What activities did you do? what scenes have impressed you?]
We learn about the useContext and reducer in today lesson. Also, we have done a great presentation today.
For the presentation, all of our group mate have well performed and I am looking forward for the lessons after.

Relection: Impressive

Interpretive:
For the lesson today I think the explaination part goes well, but for the demo, I think I need to take picture as
suggest by coach to catch up with the coding part. I think for the logic I can understand but the syntax part 
i need to search online. I think I need to take a look at different textbook of react this weekend to better understand
the concept.

Decisional: 
I will try to understand more one the react concept and adopt the concept I learn to code actual example with it.
